Place your resume PDF here and name it `resume.pdf`.

When the file `public/resume.pdf` exists, the "Download Resume" button in the navbar will download it.

To add your resume:
1. Copy your PDF file into this `public/` folder.
2. Rename it to `resume.pdf`.

You can also replace the file path in `src/components/Navbar.tsx` to point to a different URL if you host it elsewhere.
